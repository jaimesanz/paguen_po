PaguenPo
=============

"PaguenPo" (roughly translated to "PayUp") is a web application developed to solve a variety of problems that arise from living with roommates. From balancing the contributions of the users to the common purse, to generating statistics about the monthly expenses of the group. It runs on Python 3.4.3 using the Django framework along with PostgresSQL.
